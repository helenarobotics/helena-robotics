To build the widget, make sure you have a recent version of Java and Ant.

To build, type 'ant'.

To run, type 'ant run', which builds the classes, creates a jar, copies the
jar to the extension directory, and then runs the Smarthdashboard jarfile
which then recognizes the new widget jarfile and allows it to be loaded.
