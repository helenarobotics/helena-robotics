How to Run this widget:
	-First get SmartDashboard from 
	 http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/frs/do/viewSummary/projects.smartdashboard/frs

	-To build you need to have the SmartDashboard.jar as a library along with the
	 other files in the lib folder in this directory. Your builded jar shouldn't
	 have a main class specified in it's manifest. Any classes that extend Widget
	 or StaticWidget are automatically detected by SmartDashboard.

	-The widget's jar then is placed in SmartDashboard's extension folder. The
	 lib folder inside of the extension folder also should have the jars found in
	 the lib folder of the directory this file is in.

	-Since this widget is a StaticWidget it does not require a Robot to run.
	 However, to run, a camera with anonymous view enabled is required.

	-The widget should be listed as 'Camera w/ Overlay (EK)' under the View > Add
	 menu.
