Git 
====
Git is a tool that is used for tracking changes to a project. The main goal of
Git is to allow users to track progress of the projects development. By doing
this, users can to un-due changes that might have stopped code from working.
Git also makes it easy for several developers to work together, without having
to copy over each other's files and compare differences and modify each other's
'working copies'

Installation
------------
Two Software programs are required to get Git running on Windows, msysgit(the 
actual git software) and TortoiseGit (a nice GUI interface)

### mysygit
1. Download the latest version at http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
  * The file name should look like **Git-X.X.X.X-preview.exe**
2. During installation, in 'Select Components', dselect "Windows Explorer integration"
3. Complete installation

### TortoiseGit
1. Download the latest version at http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list
  * The file should look like **TortoiseGit-X.X.X.X-32bit.msi**
2. Install using default instructions

Get the Code
-------------
NOTE: this requires an internet connection

To get the code off the site All you need to do is:

1. Open Explorer(the file browser) to the folder you want the source code to be at
2. Right like on an empty space
3. Select "Git Clone..."
4. Copy "https://code.google.com/p/helena-robotics/" into the URL field
5. Click ok
6. Congrats, you now have all the source code in this project

Create your own repository
---------------------------
You don't need copy an existing project, you can create your own.

1. Go to a project you are working on
2. Right click on a blank space
3. Select "Git create repository here..."
4. Now right click on each file in your project and go to "tortoisegit -> add..."
5. After you have added all your files and folders, Right click again on a blank
   space and select "Git Commit -> Master"
6. You will be asked for your name and email. Enter them now
7. Type your message and click "Ok"
8. Congratulations, you have created your 1st git respo

Saving changes (Commit)
------------------------
Git needs to be told when to save changes, just like in Word before there was
auto-save(I might be getting old)

Commiting is simple:

1. Add any new files that you might have created since you last commited
2. Right click on a black space while within the project folder.
3. Select "Git Commit -> Master" and type a useful message about what you have
   done.

Undoing mistakes (Revert)
-------------------------
First lets look at what you have changed and see if it's a simple mistake

1. Open the TortoiseGit menu
2. Select 'Diff'
3. Double-click on files that show up.
  * changes will be highlighted
  * Look at changes and see if they make sense

If you can't find out and just want to go back to how the files where
WARNING: You will lose all changes to files you revert

1. Open the TortoiseGit menu
2. Select 'Revert...'
3. Select files you want to change back
4. Click 'Ok'

What now
---------
Git as a very powerful tool, but takes time to learn. I have skipped many
Important topics in the interest of getting you started quickly

Once you feel comfortable, please learn more about git!

Important topics to know:

* Branch - allows you to work on new features while keeping a working copy
  at all times
* Merge - lets you add changes you or other people have done automatically
* Log - Look at previous changes you have done

Resources
----------
Here is a list of great Git resources:

* [Git Community Book](http://book.git-scm.com/) - Great walkthough
* [Git resource page](http://git-scm.com/documentation) - Additional help
* Me, Chris :) - Feel free ask me any questions, Git can do more then you think
