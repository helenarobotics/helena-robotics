I used the instructions on the following URL as a basis to create the project.

  http://www.team2168.org/index.php/resources/programming/268-setting-up-your-development-environment 

Instead of copying an existing project, I boot-strapped the process using the
existing Netbeans project, since it did the initial setup for me (setting
the main project for the Midlet, etc..)

I (personally) dislike Netbeans, but still need to use it (and it's plugin
updates) to stay up-to-date with the latest code-base, but use Eclipse to
edit/build the project, since it's a much nicer environment and one that I'm
much more familiar with as I use it 8+ hours everyday in my paying job.
